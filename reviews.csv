WORKS WITH VERIZON AND T-MOBILE IN US, North Carolina to b exact!",29/11/2023,"Phone was delivered on time great packaging and had to give driver one time password in order to get it which I really appreciate considering how absolutely fuked this world has become...but that's a story for another day lol! This is my 3rd POCO phone so I had an idea of what to expect and of course I was not let down. I have had Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra, wife has Google 8 Pro, I have OnePlus10t (which I still have and Is a very good phone as well) and the list goes on tbh, way on! Lol....anyway hands down would take this phone or the F series anyday over all of the above and for absolute certain over any iPhone from the 4 to the freaking iPhone 69!!! U can't beat it for the price it's a no brainer awesome performance, really good camera, great battery life, extremely fast 67w charger 4% to 100% in right at 30 min plus a 51w car charger as well in the bundle, the specs at the moment are hard to beat and tbh in my opinion the only phone that has any better specs would b the F5 5g or F5 5g Pro but the X5 Pro certainly hasn't let me down by anymeans! Will update if anything changes for sure. As for connection I was really worried bc on my Poco F4 Pro and my X3 Pro they both worked with Straight talk until they didn't anymore lol whenever Verizon bought them out or whatever it was a cpl years ago. So was hesitant at first didn't know bc I read ppl were having issues with T-Mobile and Xiaomi themselves say won't work with Verizon but I wanted a really good phone at a VERY good price so I went for it. When I got the phone I stuck my T-Mobile sim in and what do u kno it worked although my service at my home wasn't existent lol so I told my wife screw it I'm gonna try my Verizon sim just to see what happens (hell what could it hurt) so I did and HOLY HELL BUTTMAN what do u kno 5g 4 bars in my bedroom!!!! Felt like I struck gold haha.... So now I have my T-Mobile sim in (for not so important ppl) along with my Verizon sim (for ppl I want to talk to) lol and haven't been anywhere so far that I don't have really good service! Absolutety worth every penny by any means!!!! Would highly recommend this phone to literally anyone, well except ppl I don't like go buy u an iPhone 4 they are great lmmfao!!! üòÅü§£üíØ"

Nice phone",25/11/2023,"I use Samsung Galaxy phones for years, but I decide to try the Xiaomi brand to compare. I travel oversea, and will visit four countries in a few months. I will use the Poco X5 Pro as my primary phone with the local GSM sim cards, and use my Galaxy 22+ as a backup phone. It is a good practice to have a backup phone in foreign countries. The Poco X5 Pro works well with T-Mobile. I have both T-Mobile and Verizon cell services. The Poco X5 Pro is a GSM only phone. Since over 80 percents of the world are using the GSM technology, I should be ok with this phone. Verizon is the only major mobile company using CDMA. Both T-Mobile and AT&T are GSM. I like the color, the price, the speed, and the fingerprint design of the Poco X5 Pro. If Xiaomi upgrades this phone to support both GSM and CDMA technologies, it will be a 5-star phone. I give a 5-star review because there is no 4.5 star rating."

Pasa la prueba",21/10/2023,"Como un tel√©fono de gama media es muy bueno. Hace algunos meses hab√≠a comprado el redmi 12 pro plus pero lo devolv√≠ porque no recib√≠a se√±al, ten√≠a dudas en comprar otro xaomi pero no me quejo. Pienso que el anterior ten√≠a alg√∫n defecto de f√°brica como suele pasar en otros modelos. Tengo casi 2 meses con este y sin problemas."

Excellent phone for the price",04/10/2023,I bought this to replace a good phone the Xiaomi T12 that I liked but was defective which I returned and so far I love this phone and it has had zero issues it does everything I need in a mid range phone. For sone reason someone marked this as returned and not the T12 but not a big deal for me. I am very very happy with this phone.

Great smartphone",26/08/2023,"Ive had this phone for a couple of months now and its been great. Solid battery life, bright screen, very responsive, and solid camera. Everything you want in a smartphone without paying those ridiculous price tags. I had some difficulty getting wifi calling to work at first, but some searching on google fixed that problem. No major complaints yet! I do wish the screen could get a bit brighter for those sunny days, but its good enough. The speaker isnt going to blow you away, but its good enough for some gaming or watching videos. I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a solid phone for the price."

Phone does not appear to work with cricket sim card",30/10/2023,The plus side of this product is that it came 2 days earlier than scheduled which was really nice. The phone was presented really well and felt great. But I spent hours trying to get this phone to recognize my cricket sim card since it's advertised as an unlocked phone for all carriers. I did some research and apparently there has been issues with Xiaomi phones and cricket/att carriers. I've done everything to see if the problem was on my end. As a result I'll be returning this product.

Works great for T-Mobile",10/07/2023,"A lot of people have mentioned how this phone does not have 5g in the US. I use my phone for just about everything and don't really see the need for 5g on a mobile device. 4g speeds are sufficient for almost all uses. With that being said, this phone is an AWESOME value. It has an excellent camera and works great. It also has an IR blaster which I find to be a cool feature that not many phones have anymore. It allows you to change the channel on your TV without having to sync to it. I would 100 percent recommend this phone to anyone."

I will use the Poco X5 Pro as my primary phone with the local GSM sim cards, and use my Galaxy 22+ as a backup phone. It is a good practice to have a backup phone in foreign countries. The Poco X5 Pro works well with T-Mobile. I have both T-Mobile and Verizon cell services. The Poco X5 Pro is a GSM only phone. Since over 80 percents of the world are using the GSM technology, I should be ok with this phone. Verizon is the only major mobile company using CDMA. Both T-Mobile and AT&T are GSM. I like the color, the price, the speed, and the fingerprint design of the Poco X5 Pro. If Xiaomi upgrades this phone to support both GSM and CDMA technologies, it will be a 5-star phone. I give a 5-star review because there is no 4.5 star rating."

Pasa la prueba",21/10/2023,"Como un tel√©fono de gama media es muy bueno. Hace algunos meses hab√≠a comprado el redmi 12 pro plus pero lo devolv√≠ porque no recib√≠a se√±al, ten√≠a dudas en comprar otro xaomi pero no me quejo. Pienso que el anterior ten√≠a alg√∫n defecto de f√°brica como suele pasar en otros modelos. Tengo casi 2 meses con este y sin problemas."

Excellent phone for the price",04/10/2023,I bought this to replace a good phone the Xiaomi T12 that I liked but was defective which I returned and so far I love this phone and it has had zero issues it does everything I need in a mid range phone. For sone reason someone marked this as returned and not the T12 but not a big deal for me. I am very very happy with this phone.

Great smartphone",26/08/2023,"Ive had this phone for a couple of months now and its been great. Solid battery life, bright screen, very responsive, and solid camera. Everything you want in a smartphone without paying those ridiculous price tags. I had some difficulty getting wifi calling to work at first, but some searching on google fixed that problem. No major complaints yet! I do wish the screen could get a bit brighter for those sunny days, but its good enough. The speaker isnt going to blow you away, but its good enough for some gaming or watching videos. I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a solid phone for the price."

Phone does not appear to work with cricket sim card",30/10/2023,The plus side of this product is that it came 2 days earlier than scheduled which was really nice. The phone was presented really well and felt great. But I spent hours trying to get this phone to recognize my cricket sim card since it's advertised as an unlocked phone for all carriers. I did some research and apparently there has been issues with Xiaomi phones and cricket/att carriers. I've done everything to see if the problem was on my end. As a result I'll be returning this product.

Works great for T-Mobile",10/07/2023,"A lot of people have mentioned how this phone does not have 5g in the US. I use my phone for just about everything and don't really see the need for 5g on a mobile device. 4g speeds are sufficient for almost all uses. With that being said, this phone is an AWESOME value. It has an excellent camera and works great. It also has an IR blaster which I find to be a cool feature that not many phones have anymore. It allows you to change the channel on your TV without having to sync to it. I would 100 percent recommend this phone to anyone."

WORKS WITH VERIZON AND T-MOBILE IN US, North Carolina to b exact!",29/11/2023,"Phone was delivered on time great packaging and had to give driver one time password in order to get it which I really appreciate considering how absolutely fuked this world has become...but that's a story for another day lol! This is my 3rd POCO phone so I had an idea of what to expect and of course I was not let down. I have had Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra, wife has Google 8 Pro, I have OnePlus10t (which I still have and Is a very good phone as well) and the list goes on tbh, way on! Lol....anyway hands down would take this phone or the F series anyday over all of the above and for absolute certain over any iPhone from the 4 to the freaking iPhone 69!!! U can't beat it for the price it's a no brainer awesome performance, really good camera, great battery life, extremely fast 67w charger 4% to 100% in right at 30 min plus a 51w car charger as well in the bundle, the specs at the moment are hard to beat and tbh in my opinion the only phone that has any better specs would b the F5 5g or F5 5g Pro but the X5 Pro certainly hasn't let me down by anymeans! Will update if anything changes for sure. As for connection I was really worried bc on my Poco F4 Pro and my X3 Pro they both worked with Straight talk until they didn't anymore lol whenever Verizon bought them out or whatever it was a cpl years ago. So was hesitant at first didn't know bc I read ppl were having issues with T-Mobile and Xiaomi themselves say won't work with Verizon but I wanted a really good phone at a VERY good price so I went for it. When I got the phone I stuck my T-Mobile sim in and what do u kno it worked although my service at my home wasn't existent lol so I told my wife screw it I'm gonna try my Verizon sim just to see what happens (hell what could it hurt) so I did and HOLY HELL BUTTMAN what do u kno 5g 4 bars in my bedroom!!!! Felt like I struck gold haha.... So now I have my T-Mobile sim in (for not so important ppl) along with my Verizon sim (for ppl I want to talk to) lol and haven't been anywhere so far that I don't have really good service! Absolutety worth every penny by any means!!!! Would highly recommend this phone to literally anyone, well except ppl I don't like go buy u an iPhone 4 they are great lmmfao!!! üòÅü§£üíØ"
